The Free Market Heroes Podcast is an interview podcast hosted by Adam Bradley. Adam has found a unique group of business professionals. There are thousands of business professionals who are also part-time elected officials. Only a special person can run a business and represent constituents at the same time. Adam calls these people Free Market Heroes. They are saving the free market from both sides of the game; business and politics.  Free Market Heroes is not a political podcast, its a business/motivational podcast. Here is what you will get out it: the Heroes that Adam interviews share stories and experiences that will motivate, educate and inspire you to do that thing you have been wanting to do. Strap on your cape, enter our universe and listen so you too can become a Free Market Hero!
